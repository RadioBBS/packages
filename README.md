# packages
The "eulenfunk/packages" branch "v2016.2" is deprecated. 
the repository is kept visible for archive purposes (and since there are routers in the field for which this is the firmware in place) 

It is strongly recommended to use the "v2016.2.x" branch for future builds of freifunk/gluon "v2016.2.x"
